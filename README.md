## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Position: fixed for purple and gray backgrounds
- Coolors.co tool for extracting colors from images

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned how to position elements in the background of my page. I also used various tools to complete this project, which helped me learn how to utilize different development tools.

Here's an example of the CSS code I used for the background:

```css
.background-one {
    position: fixed;
    top: -60px;
    left: -10%;
    width: 60%;
    height: 520px;
    z-index: 1;
    background: linear-gradient(45deg, var(--purple-500), var(--pink-400));
    border-bottom-right-radius: 350px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on:
- Advanced CSS animations and transitions
- Responsive design techniques
- CSS architecture and organization
- Performance optimization
